**How to access event recordings**

- [Follow me -Asim- on twitter](https://twitter.com/asimunawar) (I tweet about the latest developments and events related to Neuro-Symbolic AI and Generative AI)
- Wait for approval (take a few hours at most)
- Access playbacks and other content like slide pdfs, QAs, Chat history etc. at [Neuro-Symbolic AI Summer School 2023 - Playback](https://twitter.com/asimunawar/status/1696850589299229130)
- `Subscribe to my YouTube Channel to get timely access to all future uploads (I plan to add content from previous events too)`

Note: In case you have some concerns using Twitter (X), you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asimmunawar/) or Email (ASIM ATMARK IBM DOT COM). However, it may take some time for me to reply back.
