Please join us for the 4rd Neuro-Symbolic AI Summer School (NSSS), a free, fully-remote meeting to be held **Aug 14-15, 2025** - where you can learn how to be part of this exciting area at the most forward-looking cutting edge of AI.

NSSS â€˜25 is the latest in a series of events which alternate between research workshops and summer schools that aim to accelerate progress in the fast-emerging area of neuro-symbolic AI by teaching graduate students, data scientists, and researchers principles from the side of AI they may be less familiar with, as well as presenting a curation of emerging research ideas at the intersection.

The focus of the event is on techniques, in particular those which augment neural network/ML ideas with symbolic AI ideas, to address at least three main open problems of AI: 1) human interpretability/controllability, 2) learning with less data/computation (e.g. via knowledge), and 3) out-of-distribution generalization (e.g. via reasoning).

........................................

Background on previous events:

Our last Neuro-Symbolic Summer School event (2023), attracted 3500+ registrants and featured top researchers including two Turing Award winners, Les Valiant and Yoshua Bengio.

- [Summer 2024 (3rd education event)](https://neurosymbolic.github.io/nsss2024/)
- [Winter 2024: AAAI 2024 Workshop on Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning in the era of Large Language Models (NucLeaR) (3rd research event)](https://nuclear-workshop.github.io/)
- [Summer 2023: 3500+ registrations (2nd education event)](https://neurosymbolic.github.io/nsss2023)
- [Winter 2023: 5000+ registrations (2nd research event)](https://ibm.biz/nsworkshop2023)
- [Summer 2022: 6000+ registrations (1st educational event)](http://ibm.biz/nsss2022)
- [Winter 2022: 1500+ registrations (1st research event)](http://ibm.biz/ns-wkshp)

These activities are now general research community events under the auspices of the new non-profit [Centaur AI Institute](https://centaurinstitute.org), organized in collaboration with leaders of the NeSy annual meeting, owing to the explosion of interest in this emerging topic we have observed.
